      <p>
        Using cron expressions allow a great deal of flexibility but are
        sometimes tricky to write. A detailed description about the cron
        expression supported by Quartz can be found 
        <a href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html">here</a>.
